+ 👋🏼 Hi I'm Sebastián Atlántico Rodríguez Capurro
+. I was born in Corrientes, Argentina, on January 15, 1990.
+ All my life, I was surrounded by musical instruments and computers. So it's no coincidence that I've spent my entire life creating my sounds, music, and tiny programs.
+ I started formal programming around 2017, and I loved it. I took several courses to scratch the surface of a lot of programming languages, but my goal is to meet a powerful high-level language with the capabilities of system-level low-level languages.
+ I became a Linux and Mac OS user, so there I met the power of the terminal.
+ I speak Spanish and English.

### Nowadays (2023), 
I primarily work with JSX and TSX.
+ Despite that, my best programming language (and my first love) is Python3, and I'm very excited for the arrival of Mojo.
+ I follow the progress of new programming languages such as V and Zig, among others.
+ I also worked with Lua, SuperCollider, Flutter (Dart), C#, C++, C, and Rust.

> The content of this account is not very representative of my path traveled, since I work with other private accounts for my work. However, I utilize it to contribute to some open-source projects.
