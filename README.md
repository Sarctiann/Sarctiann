## *Short Intro:*

+ 👋🏼 Hi I'm Sebastián Atlántico Rodríguez Capurro
+ 🚼 I'm Corrientes, Argentina and I was born in 1990

+ All my life I was surrounded by 🎹musical instruments🎸 and 💻computers🖥. So it's no coincidence that I've spent my entire life creating my own 🔊sounds, 🎶music, 📄programs, and 🏹custom articles.

+ Not long ago I started in formal programming, and I love it, I learned Python3 PHP, C, C ++, Rust, JS among others. And I became a linux user ❤ so there I met the power of the terminal 😍.

+ It didn't take me long to dive into this. And I learned how to use GIT, databases like SQL and MongoDB. And web frameworks like Django, Flask, and REST Framework (I love the API philosophy 👍🏼). Also, I learned tkinter (a famous Python TCL GUI library) with which I programmed various tools that I use every day in my work.

So ... 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼 I'm eager to find people to share with and continue to grow in this way
