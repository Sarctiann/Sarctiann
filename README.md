## *Short Intro 📍 :*

+ 👋🏼 Hi I'm Sebastián Atlántico Rodríguez Capurro
+ 🚼 I was born in 🏠 Corrientes, Argentina on 📆 January 15, 1990.

+ All my life I was surrounded by 🎹 musical instruments and 💻 computers. So it's no coincidence that I've spent my entire life creating my own 🔊 sounds, 🎶 music, 📄 programs, and 🏹 custom items.

+ Not long ago I started in formal programming, and I love it, I learned Python3, PHP, C, C ++, Rust, JS among others. And I became a linux user ❤ so there I met the power of the terminal 😍.

+ It didn't take me long to dive into this. And I learned how to use GIT, databases like SQL and MongoDB. And web frameworks like Django, Flask, and REST Framework (I love the API philosophy 👍🏼). Also, I learned tkinter (a famous TCL GUI library from python standard library) with which I programmed various tools that I use every day in my work.

So ... 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼 I'm eager to find people to share with and continue to grow in this way
