# *Short Intro 📍 :*

+ 👋🏼 Hi I'm Sebastián Atlántico Rodríguez Capurro
+ 🚼 I was born in 🏠 Corrientes, Argentina on 📆 January 15, 1990.

+ All my life I was surrounded by 🎹 musical instruments and 💻 computers. So it's no coincidence that I've spent my entire life creating my own 🔊 sounds, 🎶 music, 📄 programs, and 🏹 custom items.

+ Not long ago I started in formal programming, and I love it, I learned Python3, PHP, C, C ++, Rust, JS among others. And I became a linux user ❤ so there I met the power of the terminal 😍.

+ It didn't take me long to dive into this. And I learned how to use GIT, databases like SQL and MongoDB. And web frameworks like Django, Flask, and REST Framework (I love the API philosophy 👍🏼). Also, I learned tkinter (a famous TCL GUI library from python standard library) with which I programmed various tools that I use every day in my work.

So ... 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼 I'm eager to find people to share with and continue to grow in this way

# *About me 📋 :*

+ 🟢 I'm a Python3 Developer mostly
+ 🟣 I frequently use:
    + C
    + C++
    + JS
    + Rust
    +  But I also have knowledge of many other programming languages.
+ 🟠 I play keyboard instruments, but my main activity is the composition of arrangements and original music.
+ 🟡 In that case I use:
     + Logic Pro X 
     + Waveform11, 
     + Korg Kronos 
     + And the SuperCollider, PureData and JUCE Frameworck (C ++) languages.
+ 💙 I'm mainly interested in audio programming, systems, back-ends, databases among other things.
+ 💬 My native language is Spanish but I also have an intermediate level of English or close 😄.

# *My Repositories 📚 :*

+ ## [SomePython3Tools](https://github.com/Sarctiann/SomePython3Tools)
    > Some python3 scripts that can be useful for beginners
    
    SortedDict Sample:
    ```python
    >>> print(a)
    {4: ['e', 30], 5: ['c', 20], 6: ['a', 10], 1: ['b', 60], 2: ['d', 50], 3: ['f', 40]}

    >>> sorted_by_key = sort_dict(a)
    >>> sorted_by_key
    {1: ['b', 60], 2: ['d', 50], 3: ['f', 40], 4: ['e', 30], 5: ['c', 20], 6: ['a', 10]}

    >>> sorted_by_second_value = sort_dict(a, 1)
    >>> sorted_by_second_value
    {6: ['a', 10], 5: ['c', 20], 4: ['e', 30], 3: ['f', 40], 2: ['d', 50], 1: ['b', 60]}

    >>> sorted_by_first_value_and_filtered_by_second = sort_dict(a, 0, 1, 20, 40)
    >>> sorted_by_first_value_and_filtered_by_second
    {5: ['c', 20], 4: ['e', 30], 3: ['f', 40]}
    ```
    
+ ## [JuceDistortions](https://github.com/Sarctiann/JuceDistortions)
    > Two distortions made with JUCE Framework C++

    I included the Juce headings just in case ... But these will not work for you because the routes of the Juce modules are in a different place in your system.
    You must open RFDistortion.jucer with Projucer to setup the exporters and generate these files properly.
    
    To work with this you should use other branch:
    ```
    git checkout master # For ToyiDistortion
        # or
    git checkout ale # For AleDistortion
    ```
    once there, (on Linux) you can build the application:
    ```
    cd Build/LinuxMakefile
    make
    ```
    To Run it:
    ```
    ./build/ToyiDistortion # For ToyiDistortion
        # or
    ./build/AleDistortion # For AleDistortion
    ```
